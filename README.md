# os.stat
Proof of concept code to test the stat function of the OS and Pathlib modules.

The genesis of this exploration was trying to see if a file had been modified since the last loop of my program in Python.

I didn't understand the output of the .stat() so I created this sample code.

At first it looked like I was getting non-sense results but there is a great deal of good information here:
